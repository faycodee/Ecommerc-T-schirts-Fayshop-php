I would advise the buyer to familiarize themselves with the site's backend and administrative tools. 
I would also recommend that they study the site's traffic patterns, user demographics, and content strategy
 to better understand how to manage and grow the site effectively. Additionally, I would offer to provide 
 training and support during the transition period to ensure a smooth handover.
